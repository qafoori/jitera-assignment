## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
First of all, let me thank you for reviewing this repo.

> ## [Online demo was deployed on vercel](https://jitera-assignment-239hyzdtw-hrghafoori.vercel.app/)

Here are some steps before you run this application on your localhost:

1. After you cloned the repo, kindly create a `.env` file in the root of project
2. in that file you just made, paste the following environment variables:

```
REACT_APP_MODE=development
REACT_APP_JSON_PLACE_HOLDER=https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
REACT_APP_DICEBEAE_AVATARS=https://avatars.dicebear.com/v2
REACT_APP_SECRET_KEY=SOME_SECRET_KEY
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAP_API=AIzaSyCbdD3BlOQZCtHqdX4b8OUPQBpJuh8iS8I
PORT=1999
```

> if the above google api did not work for you, you need to create your own api.


3. run `yarn` or `npm i`
4. run `yarn start` or `npm start`
